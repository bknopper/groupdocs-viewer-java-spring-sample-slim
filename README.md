Description
---------------
A powerful document viewer API that allows you to display over 50 document formats in your Java applications. The viewer can work two ways: by rasterizing documents or by converting them to a combination of SVG, HTML and CSS. Both methods deliver high-fidelity rendering.

Supported file formats include: Microsoft Office, Visio, Project and Outlook documents, PDFs, AutoCAD, image files (TIFF, JPG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, etc.) and more.
